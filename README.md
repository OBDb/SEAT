## About SEAT

SEAT (Sociedad Española de Automóviles de Turismo) is a Spanish automobile manufacturer founded in 1950. The company has evolved from a state-owned enterprise to becoming part of the Volkswagen Group and has established itself as an important player in the European automotive market.

## Generations

### Early SEAT (1950-1982): State-Owned Era

Founded in 1950 with support from the Spanish government and Italian automaker FIAT, SEAT initially produced FIAT models under license for the Spanish market. During this period, SEAT manufactured vehicles like the SEAT 600, which became an iconic symbol of Spain's motorization. The company operated as a state-owned enterprise focused primarily on the domestic market with limited export activities.

### Transition Period (1982-1990): Break from FIAT and VW Partnership

After the partnership with FIAT ended in 1982, SEAT began developing its own models while seeking a new industrial partner. This period saw the introduction of the first independently designed SEAT model, the Ibiza, in 1984. The Volkswagen Group acquired a minority stake in SEAT in 1986, which later increased to full ownership in 1990.

### Volkswagen Group Era (1990-Present): International Expansion

Following full acquisition by the Volkswagen Group, SEAT underwent significant modernization of its production facilities and model lineup. The company expanded its international presence while maintaining its Spanish identity and sporty character. Notable models from this era include multiple generations of the Ibiza, Leon, and Toledo, as well as newer additions like the Ateca, Arona, and Tarraco SUVs.

### Modern SEAT (2018-Present): Technology and Electrification Focus

In recent years, SEAT has placed increased emphasis on technological innovation and electrification. The company launched CUPRA as a standalone performance brand in 2018, focusing on sportier, higher-end vehicles. SEAT has also introduced hybrid and electric models as part of the Volkswagen Group's broader electrification strategy.
